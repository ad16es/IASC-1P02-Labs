  <p>Who doesn't love having a jungle in their house? House plants are a great way to spice up your interior and have many health benefits. However, it's always a concern whether one can actually keep the house plant alive, <a href="#hardtokill"> Jump to Easy Plants</a>, which is why many people opt to get fake greenery. I personally love tropical and big leaf plants. Tropical plants bring a warm and vacation vibe to any room. However, being in the climate we live in, tropical plants are difficult to keep alive. Plants create an <em>Urban Jungle</em> vibe.</p>
